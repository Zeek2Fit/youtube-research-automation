CTA Playbooks (email list and Skool)
Rules of thumb

One primary CTA per video.
Either email list (lead magnet) or Skool join. Keep the other as a soft secondary.

Speak it + show it.
Say the CTA, show the URL, put it in the first 2 lines of the description, and pin it.

Outcome-anchored language.
“Get your next 7 breakfasts planned” beats “download my PDF.”

Two-step nudges.
Mid-roll reminder connects the lesson to the CTA outcome, not to “support the channel.”

Mid-roll nudge templates (20–30s each)

Community nudge:
“Form-check Friday is this week in Skool. If you want eyes on your squat or deadlift, jump in and post a 10-second clip. Link is pinned.”

Short CTA snippets you can drop anywhere

“Screenshot the on-screen checklist, then grab the one-pager in the first link.”

“Comment ‘PROOF’ if you’re starting. I’ll reply with the exact 30-minute template.”

“Two things can be true: you’re busy and you can get fit. First link shows you how.”
