Business & Brand Details
1. Your Content Niche:

Health & Fitness for Busy Fathers — designed specifically for overwhelmed but ambitious men (ages 30–45) who want to reclaim strength, energy, and leadership in their lives without sacrificing work or family.

Your brand stands out by offering time-efficient, real-world strategies rooted in:

Fitness & Strength: 30-minute workouts that build practical, functional muscle
